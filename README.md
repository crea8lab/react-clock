Creating a beautiful react-clock interface


## Getting Started

The following steps will get you started.

1. Clone the repo... **NOTE:** **Clone the repo and not Fork**
2. Checkout to a branch other than **master** and **staging**. Ideally, you can name each branch with the name of the current feature-set you are working on.
3. Run `yarn install` to install all required dependencies.
4. Code away.

## Pull Requests

When you are done with your work and you want to `push` your local branch and have it merged into the master, follow these steps.

### Step 1 - Update your local

To update your local branch, run `git pull origin staging`. This will pull the latest changes in the remote `<cloud>` branch into your `<local>` branch.

Beware of **`merge conflicts`**

> Anytime you have a merge conflict, try to resolve this yourself with the help of `vscode`. And please reach out for guidance on the process.

### Step 2 - Push your branch

After updating your local branch, and fixing any merge-conflict then push your branch by running: `git push origin <your-branch-name>`

After pushing is done, then click on **`Pull Request`** to send a PR.

## Start Up

You can start the development server with `yarn start`;
